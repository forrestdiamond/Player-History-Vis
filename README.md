# Player-History-Vis
A repository for the code we made for our Baseball Hack Day submission
created with John Dwyer

Inspiration
Remember Grantland? Man, what a great website. Anyway, Ben Lindbergh once wrote an article there on transaction trees that caught our eye. To make the article Ben had to go through every player rostered on every team and follow back their transaction history on Baseball Reference. In his words, "it was hell."

We wanted to automate it!

What it does
Right now our program will take in a Retrosheet player ID and output an image showing the player's transaction history. Every trade, signing, release- it's all in there.
